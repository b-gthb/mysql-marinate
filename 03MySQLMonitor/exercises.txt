3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

monitor user refers to username used when connecting to database not associated with username at os login or underwhich server is running.
password - optional parameter passed to server associated with users to insure only user associated with that password is admitted for that computing session.
database - specifies which database to use and foregoes user having to enter database.  if omitted user can specify database at end of mysql commands.
